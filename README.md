# Super-Store-Sales-dashboard-PowerBI

📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive dashboard built using the Superstore dataset.
The dataset includes sales, profit, discount, and shipping details across various product categories, sub-categories, customer segments, and regions.
The dashboard aims to provide business insights and support data-driven decisions.

The dashboard is designed to help business users answer the following:

📈 Sales & Profit Trends – How are sales and profits performing over time?


🌍 Regional Performance – Which regions/states contribute most to sales and profits?

🏷 Category Insights – Which product categories and sub-categories drive business growth?

💰 Profitability Analysis – Are discounts impacting profitability?

👥 Customer Segmentation – Which customer segments bring the highest revenue?

📌 Key Insights (Example)

The West Region generates the highest sales, but South Region has lower profit margins.

Technology category is the most profitable, while Furniture often incurs losses due to discounts.

High discounts correlate with reduced profit in several sub-categories.
